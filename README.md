# Software Engineering | Oct23 - Jan24

- Gained valuable experience in utilizing the Spring framework for implementing various functionalities in a server-client based game.
- Developed the project in Java, spanning the entire software development life-cycle from initial requirement analysis to software testing.
- Acquired practical knowledge in coding best practices and software testing methodologies.
- Learned about different project management methodologies and the importance of comprehensive planning throughout the project lifecycle.

Achieved 23/25 for client, 47% higher than the class average of 15 points and 15/19 for server. 

Game Idea: 
- Two clients, players, each generate a half map, which the server combines into one map.
- Each client uses its own search algorithm to find a treasure on its side of the map ($$$).
- Once the treasure has been found, the client that finds the opponent's castle first wins.
- All rules of the game are controlled by the server (e.g. one move per round, entering a water tile leads to the opponent winning, ...)

Used MVC pattern to display the game play in the console.

(green tiles are grass fields, yellow are mountains, blue water)
(purple P and C, players position and castle)
(red E, position of the enemy/opponent)
