# Software Engineering | Oct23 - Jan24

The idea of this project is to create a server/client based game where each client crates its own half mao and tries to find a hidden treasure. This courses really taught me the whole process of creating a Software project, from requirement analysis all the way to testing. I learned a lot about very important coding practices, design patterns, different ways of building a project etc. A great course! :) 

This program was done within the Spring framework, in this repository you will only find /src files, for upload reasons.

Achieved 23/25 for client and 15/19 for server.
